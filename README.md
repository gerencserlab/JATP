# Measuring glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP fluxes (JATP) using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analysis

Excel calculation worksheets are provided here to convert common readouts of the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer into pmoles of ATP produced per time by the sample, enabling a direct comparison of the two ATP producing pathways, glycolysis and mitochondria (including oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation).
The worksheets calculate ATP fluxes from OCR and ECAR values measured in glycolytic and mitochondrial stress test paradigms. The detailed workbook allows performing the calculation assuming combination of substrates, including glucose, pyruvate, palmitate and glutamine.  

The technology is described here (open access): [Quantifying intracellular rates of glycolytic and oxidative ATP production and consumption using extracellular flux measurements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820429084?via%3Dihub).

The calculation of JATP requires the buffering power of the medium, as described here (open access): [Measurement and Analysis of Extracellular Acid Production to Determine Glycolytic Rate](https://www.jove.com/t/53464/measurement-analysis-extracellular-acid-production-to-determine). 

This repository contains the latest Excel worksheets for calculation of buffering power and JATP:

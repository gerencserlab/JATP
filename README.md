# Measuring glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP fluxes (JATP) using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analysis

The technology1 is described here (open access): [Quantifying intracellular rates of glycolytic and oxidative ATP production and consumption using extracellular flux measurements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820429084?via%3Dihub).

The calculation of JATP requires the buffering power2 of the medium, as described here (open access): Measurement and Analysis of Extracellular Acid Production to Determine Glycolytic Rate.

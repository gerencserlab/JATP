# Measuring glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP fluxes (JATP) using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analysis

Calculation worksheets are provided here to convert common readouts of the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer into pmoles of ATP produced per time by the sample, enabling a direct comparison of the two ATP producing pathways, glycolysis and mitochondria (including oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation).

The technology is described here (open access): [Quantifying intracellular rates of glycolytic and oxidative ATP production and consumption using extracellular flux measurements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820429084?via%3Dihub).

The calculation of JATP requires the buffering power of the medium, as described here (open access): [Measurement and Analysis of Extracellular Acid Production to Determine Glycolytic Rate](https://www.jove.com/t/53464/measurement-analysis-extracellular-acid-production-to-determine). 

This repository contains the latest Excel worksheets for calculation of buffering power and JATP:
* Original simplified workbook for scenarios where the only substrate is glucose, with the changes in the 2018 erratum applied: [JATP_simplified_calculation_glucose_2023.xlsx](JATP_simplified_calculation_glucose_2023.xlsx)
* Latest detailed workbook (mixed substrates): [JATP_full_calculation_2023.xlsx](JATP_full_calculation_2023.xlsx)
* Latest workbook for calculation of buffering power: [Buffering_power_2023.xlsx](Buffering_power_2023.xlsx)

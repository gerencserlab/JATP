# Measuring glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP fluxes (JATP) using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analysis

The technology is described here (open access): [Quantifying intracellular rates of glycolytic and oxidative ATP production and consumption using extracellular flux measurements](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820429084?via%3Dihub).

The calculation of JATP requires the buffering power of the medium, as described here (open access): [Measurement and Analysis of Extracellular Acid Production to Determine Glycolytic Rate](https://www.jove.com/t/53464/measurement-analysis-extracellular-acid-production-to-determine). 

This repository contains the latest Excel worksheets for calculation of buffering power and JATP:
•	Original simplified workbook for scenarios where the only substrate is glucose, with the changes in the 2018 erratum applied: [JATP_simplified_calculation_glucose_2023.xlsx](JATP_simplified_calculation_glucose_2023.xlsx)
•	Latest detailed workbook (mixed substrates): [JATP_full_calculation_2023.xlsx](JATP_full_calculation_2023.xlsx)
•	Latest workbook for calculation of buffering power: [Buffering_power_2023.xlsx](Buffering_power_2023.xlsx)
